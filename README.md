## Hello, I'm Ho-Joong Kim ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Korea University.
My research focuses on computer vision and video understanding, particularly temporal action detection and object detection.
I've worked on various video-related tasks, and more recently, I've been exploring vision-language modeling to integrate visual and language representations for various video applications.
